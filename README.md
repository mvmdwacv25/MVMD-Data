The MVMD Dataset is the first dataset specifically designed for multi-view mirror detection, featuring 98 diverse scenes and a total of 3,181 images. Created using Blender 4.0.1 and augmented with real-world scenarios from VMD and MirrorNeRF, it offers images in multiple resolutions (640×480, 1280×720, 800×800, and 400×300) and ensures robust multi-view variation with inter-view angular separations exceeding 0.8 degrees and at least three images per scene. Mirrors in the dataset appear across varied image regions and in a wide range of shapes—from common forms like round and rectangular to irregular and asymmetrical designs—providing a solid foundation for training and evaluating real-world mirror detection models.
